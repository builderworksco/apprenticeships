December

Week 11/30 - 12/6

Tuesday we worked on workdesq for a bit and then started working on a different project. We used the whiteboard to map out the idea and assets we would need for each term. 

I still get the SSL error as of ~8:00am 12/4 but I'll try to work on it a little more when I get home. I'll post my errors and such with jing and maybe we can see what we can do(?). I'll try to document what I did to fix it so that this log will be useful to those who try to use windows and Ruby in the future. 

Disregard first part:

Thursday we worked on the same project, didn't do much coding, would of liked to a little but its not the end of the world. I probably could've done more on my own if I have a laptop(highly recommended). I felt like I had a few good visual suggestions(correct me if I'm wrong) but it felt like I did stuff. 

I have a lot of HTML work to do this weekend so I don't know how much I'll get around to in the way of Ruby, but I'd at least like to get my install sorted, and then do a lot of work next week when you're gone and maybe have some sort of product to show you on Thursday.

I'll update this with more later, I'm in class right now so I don't have access to any of the screencaps I took with my Ruby/Rails issues.

Helpful Cheatsheet?

Week 12/7 - 12/31
December was pretty slow. A lot of set up to get the Digital Ocean Droplet to work. Started a trail blog to get familiar with Ruby.
