End of Week 11/14
First full week of the apprenticeship. Went to Big Data Talks @ IBM and the first QA Bug Bash @ UPMC. Those were interesting, and I will be participating in the Data Jam mentioned at the first event. I would of liked to have a computer of my own at the bug bash though, it would be fun to try and break a website. I was on the team for the one that wasn't WorkDesq or Acrobatiq(no clue how to spell this).

Tuesday: First full day and got familiar with navigation in atom, as well as wrote the LinkedIn link for WorkDesq job listings. Then went to Data Talks.

Wednesday: Not actual work but I went to the Bug Bash(see above).

Thursday: we worked primarily on WorkDesq and Justin taught me mostly about how to use git properly. We did some more coding in atom and I wrote some more code for WorkDesq involving character limits for user input fields.

End of Week 11/21 

Worked on workdesq some more tuesday. No questions here.

Thursday we were with Jesse and then we went to the job fair. Im having Trouble getting rails to work on my computer. Something about a SSL error, and whenever I try to DL the file I can't get it in the format I need.

Have been trying to work through a base rails project but still no luck with rails. 
Project: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

(Writing this Monday because I forgot to on sunday)

Week 11/30 - 12/6

Tuesday we worked on workdesq for a bit and then started working on a different project. We used the whiteboard to map out the idea and assets we would need for each term. 

I still get the SSL error as of ~8:00am 12/4 but I'll try to work on it a little more when I get home. I'll post my errors and such with jing and maybe we can see what we can do(?). I'll try to document what I did to fix it so that this log will be useful to those who try to use windows and Ruby in the future. 

Thursday we worked on the same project, didn't do much coding, would of liked to a little but its not the end of the world. I probably could've done more on my own if I have a laptop(highly recommended). I felt like I had a few good visual suggestions(correct me if I'm wrong) but it felt like I did stuff. 

I have a lot of HTML work to do this weekend so I don't know how much I'll get around to in the way of Ruby, but I'd at least like to get my install sorted, and then do a lot of work next week when you're gone and maybe have some sort of product to show you on Thursday.

I'll update this with more later, I'm in class right now so I don't have access to any of the screencaps I took with my Ruby/Rails issues.
