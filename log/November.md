End of Week 11/14
First full week of the apprenticeship. Went to Big Data Talks @ IBM and the first QA Bug Bash @ UPMC. Those were interesting, and I will be participating in the Data Jam mentioned at the first event. I would of liked to have a computer of my own at the bug bash though, it would be fun to try and break a website. I was on the team for the one that wasn't WorkDesq or Acrobatiq(no clue how to spell this).

Tuesday: First full day and got familiar with navigation in atom, as well as wrote the LinkedIn link for WorkDesq job listings. Then went to Data Talks.

Wednesday: Not actual work but I went to the Bug Bash(see above).

Thursday: we worked primarily on WorkDesq and Justin taught me mostly about how to use git properly. We did some more coding in atom and I wrote some more code for WorkDesq involving character limits for user input fields.

End of Week 11/21 

Worked on workdesq some more tuesday. No questions here.

Thursday we were with Jesse and then we went to the job fair. Im having Trouble getting rails to work on my computer. Something about a SSL error, and whenever I try to DL the file I can't get it in the format I need.

Have been trying to work through a base rails project but still no luck with rails.
